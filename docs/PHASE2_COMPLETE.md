## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Matches table
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  league_id UUID REFERENCES leagues(id),
  match_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  recorded_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('completed', 'cancelled'))
);

-- Match participants table
CREATE TABLE match_participants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  match_id UUID REFERENCES matches(id),
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  score INTEGER CHECK (score >= 0),
  result TEXT CHECK (result IN ('win', 'loss')),
  UNIQUE(match_id, profile_id)
);

-- Leaderboard calculation function
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_league_standings(p_league_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  rank INTEGER,
  profile_id UUID,
  name TEXT,
  matches_played INTEGER,
  wins INTEGER,
  losses INTEGER,
  points INTEGER,
  win_rate NUMERIC
);
```

### Data Flow

**Recording a Match:**
1. User navigates to `/leagues/:id/record-match`
2. Selects 2 players from league members
3. Enters scores and results
4. Submits form → `recordMatch` action dispatched
5. `MatchEffects` calls `MatchService.recordMatch()`
6. Service validates data and creates match + participants
7. Success action updates match state
8. Leaderboard is refreshed
9. User redirected back to league detail

**Viewing Leaderboard:**
1. User views league detail page
2. `loadLeaderboard` action dispatched on init
3. `LeaderboardEffects` calls `LeaderboardService.getLeagueLeaderboard()`
4. Service calls database function `calculate_league_standings()`
5. Function calculates ranks, points, win rates
6. Results stored in leaderboard state
7. `LeaderboardComponent` displays rankings

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Integration Tests**: 
   - Use `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` for Angular 20+
   - Create test users in `beforeAll`, not `beforeEach`
   - Each test creates its own league for isolation
   - Sign back in after `signUp` (auto-signs in new user)
   - Use helper functions for common operations

2. **Column Names**:
   - Profiles table uses `name`, not `display_name`
   - Always check actual database schema
   - Restart Supabase to clear schema cache

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Follow existing patterns (league tests)
   - One test user per test suite
   - Independent tests (no shared state)
   - Cleanup in `afterAll`

### Cypress E2E
- Use `data-testid` for all selectors
- Add waits for page stabilization (2000ms)
- Use `{ force: true }` for form inputs to avoid detachment
- Create helper commands for common flows

## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 3)

Phase 3 will add:
- **Fixtures & Scheduling**: Automated match scheduling
- **Seasons**: Time-boxed competition periods
- **Round-Robin Algorithm**: Generate fair matchups
- **Calendar View**: Visual fixture schedule
- **Overdue Tracking**: Mark late submissions
