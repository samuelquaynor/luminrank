# Phase 3: Fixtures & Scheduling - Progress Report

## ✅ Completed (Backend & Integration Tests)

### Database Layer
- ✅ **Seasons Table**: Time-boxed competition periods with unique season numbering
- ✅ **Fixtures Table**: Scheduled matches with home/away players, round numbers, deadlines
- ✅ **Matches Table Updates**: Added `fixture_id` and `season_id` foreign keys
- ✅ **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive security for seasons and fixtures
- ✅ **Database Functions**:
  - `calculate_submission_deadline()` - Adds submission window to scheduled date
  - `check_submission_window()` - Validates if submission is within allowed window
  - `mark_overdue_fixtures()` - Automated job to mark late submissions
  - `get_player_fixtures()` - Retrieves all fixtures for a player with participant names

### TypeScript Models
- ✅ **Fixture Models**: `Fixture`, `FixtureWithDetails`, `CreateFixtureRequest`, `GenerateFixturesRequest`, `FixtureGenerationResult`
- ✅ **Season Models**: `Season`, `CreateSeasonRequest`, `UpdateSeasonRequest`, `SeasonWithStats`
- ✅ **Enums**: `FixtureStatus`, `SeasonStatus`

### Services
- ✅ **SeasonService**: Full CRUD operations for seasons
  - `createSeason()`, `getLeagueSeasons()`, `getActiveSeason()`, `getSeasonById()`
  - `updateSeason()`, `endSeason()`, `deleteSeason()`
  - Observable versions for RxJS integration
- ✅ **FixtureService**: Fixture generation and management
  - `generateRoundRobinFixtures()` - **Core round-robin algorithm** ⭐
  - `getLeagueFixtures()`, `getFixtureById()`, `getPlayerFixtures()`
  - `updateFixtureStatus()`, `linkMatchToFixture()`, `markOverdueFixtures()`
  - Observable versions for RxJS integration

### Round-Robin Algorithm ⭐
The crown jewel of Phase 3 - a fully tested, production-ready round-robin scheduling algorithm:

**Features:**
- ✅ Handles even and odd number of players (uses "bye" for odd)
- ✅ Ensures each player plays every other player exactly once
- ✅ Supports return fixtures (double round-robin for home/away)
- ✅ Distributes matches evenly across rounds
- ✅ Calculates scheduled dates based on match frequency
- ✅ Automatically calculates submission deadlines
- ✅ Links fixtures to seasons
- ✅ Validates minimum 2 players

**Algorithm:**
```
For N players:
- Rounds: N-1 (or 2(N-1) for return fixtures)
- Fixtures per round: N/2
- Total fixtures: N(N-1)/2 (or N(N-1) for return)

Rotation Pattern:
- Fix player 1 position
- Rotate other players clockwise each round
- Example (4 players):
  Round 1: 1-2, 3-4
  Round 2: 1-3, 2-4
  Round 3: 1-4, 2-3
```

### NgRx Stores
- ✅ **Fixture Store**: Actions, reducer, effects, selectors
  - `generateFixtures`, `loadLeagueFixtures`, `loadPlayerFixtures`
  - `updateFixtureStatus`, `linkMatchToFixture`, `markOverdueFixtures`
  - Selectors: by status (scheduled, completed, overdue), by round, upcoming
- ✅ **Season Store**: Actions, reducer, effects, selectors
  - `createSeason`, `loadLeagueSeasons`, `loadActiveSeason`
  - `updateSeason`, `endSeason`, `deleteSeason`
  - Selectors: active, upcoming, completed, by ID
- ✅ **App State Integration**: Added to `app.state.ts` and `app.config.ts`

### Integration Tests ⭐
**All 71 integration tests passing!**

#### Fixture Database Tests (16 tests)
- ✅ Seasons table creation and validation
- ✅ Fixtures table creation and validation
- ✅ Unique season numbering enforcement
- ✅ Status value validation
- ✅ Constraint enforcement (home ≠ away, deadline > scheduled)
- ✅ Database functions (deadline calculation, window checking, overdue marking)
- ✅ RLS policies (member access control, non-member blocking)
- ✅ Match-fixture linking

#### Season Service Tests (12 tests)
- ✅ Create season with full and minimal data
- ✅ Get all seasons ordered by season number
- ✅ Get active season
- ✅ Get season by ID
- ✅ Update season (full and partial)
- ✅ End season
- ✅ Delete season

#### Round-Robin Generation Tests (9 tests)
- ✅ Correct fixture count for even players (4 players = 6 fixtures)
- ✅ Correct fixture count for odd players (5 players = 10 fixtures)
- ✅ Return fixtures (double round-robin)
- ✅ Correct scheduled dates (match frequency)
- ✅ Correct submission deadlines
- ✅ Unique home/away assignments
- ✅ Complete round-robin (all pairings covered)
- ✅ Minimum player validation
- ✅ Season linking

## 🚧 In Progress (Frontend Components)

### Components to Build
1. **Generate Fixtures Wizard** (`fixtures/generate-fixtures.component`)
   - Step 1: Select/Create Season
   - Step 2: Configure Settings (start date, frequency, return fixtures, window)
   - Step 3: Preview & Confirm
   
2. **Fixtures List** (`fixtures/fixtures-list.component`)
   - Calendar view / List view toggle
   - Group by round
   - Filter by status
   - "Record Result" button per fixture

3. **Fixture Card** (`shared/fixture-card.component`)
   - Home vs Away display
   - Scheduled date and deadline
   - Status badge
   - Action buttons

4. **Season Management** (`seasons/season-management.component`)
   - List all seasons
   - Create new season
   - Start/End season actions

5. **League Detail Updates**
   - Add "Fixtures" tab
   - Integrate fixture list
   - Show active season info

### Routes to Add
- `/leagues/:id/generate-fixtures` - Fixture generation wizard
- `/leagues/:id/fixtures` - Fixtures list view
- `/leagues/:id/seasons` - Season management

## 🔄 Fixture Generation Workflow

```
League Creator/Admin
  ↓
League Detail Page → Fixtures Tab
  ↓
[Generate Fixtures] Button
  ↓
Fixture Generation Wizard
  ├─ Step 1: Select Season (or create new)
  ├─ Step 2: Configure
  │    ├─ Start Date: Date picker
  │    ├─ Match Frequency: e.g., "7 days"
  │    ├─ Return Fixtures: Checkbox (home/away)
  │    └─ Submission Window: e.g., "24 hours"
  └─ Step 3: Preview
       ├─ Shows: Total rounds, total fixtures
       ├─ Displays: Sample round 1 matchups
       └─ [Confirm Generation] → Creates all fixtures
             ↓
  Fixtures List View
    ├─ Grouped by round
    ├─ Status indicators (scheduled/completed/overdue)
    └─ [Record Result] buttons
```

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Why Round-Robin?
- **Fair**: Every player faces every other player
- **Balanced**: Even distribution of matches
- **Predictable**: Fixed schedule calculated in advance
- **Standard**: Used in most sports leagues

### Submission Windows
- **Purpose**: Time limit after scheduled date to submit results
- **Configurable**: Per league (default 24 hours)
- **Enforcement**: Automated marking of overdue fixtures
- **Flexibility**: Admin can manually extend if needed

### Season Management
- **Isolation**: Each season has independent fixtures and standings
- **Historical**: Completed seasons preserved for records
- **Active**: Only one active season per league at a time

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

1. **Service Layer for Algorithm**: Round-robin is complex business logic, belongs in service not database
2. **Database Functions for Utilities**: Simple calculations (deadlines, windows) in database for reusability
3. **RLS Security**: Ensures only league members can view/modify fixtures
4. **NgRx for State**: Fixtures/seasons used across multiple components, centralized state
5. **Integration Tests First**: Verify database works before building UI (following project rules!)
