## Technical Implementation

### Database Layer
- **Tables**: `leagues`, `league_settings`, `league_members`, `league_invites`
- **Functions**: 
  - `generate_invite_code()`: Auto-generates unique invite codes
  - `setup_new_league()`: Creates default settings and adds creator as member
  - `is_league_member()`: Checks membership (bypasses RLS)
  - `is_league_admin()`: Checks admin status (bypasses RLS)
- **Triggers**: 
  - BEFORE INSERT: Generate invite code
  - AFTER INSERT: Setup league settings and membership
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive policies for all operations
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common queries

### Service Layer
- **LeagueService**: CRUD operations, join/leave functionality
- **MemberService**: Member management, role updates, membership checks
- **LeagueSettingsService**: Settings management
- All services use RxJS Observables
- Proper error handling and logging

### State Management (NgRx)
- **Actions**: 13 league-related actions
- **Reducers**: Immutable state updates
- **Effects**: Async operations with side effects
- **Selectors**: Memoized state queries

### Frontend Components
- **LeaguesListComponent**: Display all user's leagues
- **CreateLeagueComponent**: Create new leagues with validation
- **JoinLeagueComponent**: Join via code or auto-join via link
- **LeagueDetailComponent**: View/edit league, manage settings, view members
- **LeagueCardComponent**: Reusable league card display

### Routing
- `/leagues` - List all leagues
- `/leagues/create` - Create new league
- `/leagues/join` - Join league (manual code entry)
- `/leagues/join/:code` - Join league (auto-join via link)
- `/leagues/:id` - League details

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Database Tests: 16/16 passing (100%)

### ‚úÖ E2E Tests: 22/22 passing (100%)
- Complete user workflows
- Authentication flows
- League creation and management
- Multi-user scenarios
- Navigation and routing
- Join-by-link functionality

### **Total: 146/146 tests passing (100%)** üéâ

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Trigger**: Push/PR to `main` or `dev`
- **Unit Tests**: Runs on every push/PR
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys migrations to production on `main` push

### Required Secrets
- `NG_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NG_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

See `.github/SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Bug Fixes Completed

### Database Issues
1. ‚úÖ Fixed infinite recursion in RLS policies
2. ‚úÖ Fixed foreign key references (auth.users ‚Üí profiles)
3. ‚úÖ Fixed trigger timing (BEFORE vs AFTER INSERT)
4. ‚úÖ Added missing RLS policies for profiles table
5. ‚úÖ Fixed member visibility across users

### Frontend Issues
1. ‚úÖ Fixed auth guard race condition
2. ‚úÖ Fixed navigation after join/leave operations
3. ‚úÖ Fixed state management in components
4. ‚úÖ Removed non-existent column references (avatar_url)
5. ‚úÖ Fixed SSR issues with SupabaseClient

### Testing Issues
1. ‚úÖ Fixed Cypress command definitions
2. ‚úÖ Added proper waits and assertions
3. ‚úÖ Fixed element detachment issues
4. ‚úÖ Updated test expectations to match actual behavior

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical
- SSR localStorage warnings in logs - handled correctly by StorageService (doesn't affect functionality)
