## Technical Implementation

### Database Layer
- **Tables**: `leagues`, `league_settings`, `league_members`, `league_invites`
- **Functions**: 
  - `generate_invite_code()`: Auto-generates unique invite codes
  - `setup_new_league()`: Creates default settings and adds creator as member
  - `is_league_member()`: Checks membership (bypasses RLS)
  - `is_league_admin()`: Checks admin status (bypasses RLS)
- **Triggers**: 
  - BEFORE INSERT: Generate invite code
  - AFTER INSERT: Setup league settings and membership
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive policies for all operations
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common queries

### Service Layer
- **LeagueService**: CRUD operations, join/leave functionality
- **MemberService**: Member management, role updates, membership checks
- **LeagueSettingsService**: Settings management
- All services use RxJS Observables
- Proper error handling and logging

### State Management (NgRx)
- **Actions**: 13 league-related actions
- **Reducers**: Immutable state updates
- **Effects**: Async operations with side effects (no router navigation)
- **Selectors**: Memoized state queries
- **Architecture**: Router navigation handled in components, not effects

### Frontend Components
- **LeaguesListComponent**: Display all user's leagues
- **CreateLeagueComponent**: Create new leagues with validation
- **JoinLeagueComponent**: Join via code or auto-join via link
- **LeagueDetailComponent**: View/edit league, manage settings, view members
- **LeagueCardComponent**: Reusable league card display

### Routing & Navigation
- `/leagues` - List all leagues
- `/leagues/create` - Create new league
- `/leagues/join` - Join league (manual code entry)
- `/leagues/join/:code` - Join league (auto-join via link)
- `/leagues/:id` - League details
- **Redirect Tracking**: 
  - `AuthGuard` stores intended destination in localStorage
  - `HomeComponent` handles post-auth redirects
  - Preserves user intent through login/registration/profile-setup flow

### Required Secrets
- `NG_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NG_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

See `.github/SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical

## Architecture Highlights

### Redirect Tracking System
A clean, maintainable approach to preserving user intent through authentication:

1. **AuthGuard** (`auth.guard.ts`)
   - Intercepts unauthenticated access to protected routes
   - Stores intended destination in `localStorage` as `auth_return_url`
   - Redirects to `/auth?returnUrl=...` with query param for visibility

2. **Auth Component** (`auth.component.ts`)
   - Listens to `loginSuccess` and `registerSuccess` actions
   - Handles navigation to home or profile-setup
   - No router logic in NgRx effects (clean separation of concerns)

3. **Home Component** (`home.component.ts`)
   - Checks for `auth_return_url` in localStorage on load
   - Redirects to stored URL if present
   - Clears the stored URL after redirect

4. **Profile Setup** (`profile-setup.component.ts`)
   - Redirects to home after profile completion
   - Home component handles final redirect to intended destination

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Clean separation: Guards handle access, components handle navigation
- ‚úÖ No router navigation in state management (NgRx best practice)
- ‚úÖ SSR-compatible with platform checks
- ‚úÖ Preserves user intent through multi-step auth flows

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized database queries with proper indexes
- Memoized selectors in NgRx
- Lazy-loaded routes
- Efficient RLS policies using helper functions
- Platform-aware localStorage access (no SSR errors)
