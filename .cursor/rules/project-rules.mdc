# LuminRank Project Rules

## Testing
- Use `data-testid` attributes for all Cypress element selection
- Never use class names or text content for element selection in E2E tests
- Preserve query params and localStorage when testing redirect flows
- Stub clipboard API in Cypress tests to avoid focus issues
- **ALWAYS write integration tests FIRST** to verify database queries and RLS policies work before implementing frontend/state management
- Integration tests should follow the pattern in `league.service.integration.spec.ts`:
  - Use `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` in TestBed
  - Create one test user in `beforeAll`
  - Each test creates its own league/data for isolation
  - Use helper functions for common operations (createTestLeague, createOpponent)
  - Sign back in as test user after creating new users (signUp auto-signs in)
  - Clean up in `afterAll` (leagues cascade delete to matches, members, settings)
  - Database column: profiles use `name`, not `display_name`
- **Integration tests verify DATABASE operations**, E2E tests verify UI displays data correctly
- E2E tests should verify data displays (not just empty states):
  - Check for actual player names, scores, dates in rendered HTML
  - Use `.should('contain', 'Player Name')` to verify data renders
  - Test with real data, not just form validation

## Architecture
- **NO router navigation in NgRx effects** - Handle all navigation in components
- Router navigation should only be in: Components, Guards
- Effects should only handle data operations and side effects (not navigation)
- Follow separation of concerns: Guards = access control, Components = navigation

## State Management (NgRx)
- Effects handle async operations and data transformations
- Components listen to actions for navigation decisions
- No router injection in effects unless absolutely necessary
- Keep effects focused on data, not UI concerns

## SSR Compatibility
- Always check `isPlatformBrowser()` before accessing browser-only APIs
- Use `PLATFORM_ID` injection for platform detection
- Never access `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `window` without platform checks
- Use `gen_random_uuid()` instead of `uuid_generate_v4()` in PostgreSQL (built-in, no extension needed)

## Database
- Use `gen_random_uuid()` for UUID generation (PostgreSQL 13+ built-in)
- Foreign keys should reference `public.profiles(id)`, not `auth.users(id)`
- Use `SECURITY DEFINER` functions to bypass RLS when needed (avoid infinite recursion)
- Always test RLS policies with pgTAP

## Git Workflow
- Never perform git operations automatically
- User handles all commits, pushes, pulls, merges
- Provide code changes only, let user manage version control

## Code Style
- Use standalone Angular components
- Prefer reactive patterns (Observables) over imperative
- Use strict TypeScript types
- Follow Angular style guide for naming conventions
